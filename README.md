# Identifying-and-Addressing-Outliers
In this repository, I have demonstrated how to identify and address outliers in pandas DataFrames.
This repository explores the concepts of outliers and demonstrates various techniques for identifying and handling them within pandas DataFrames. Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the majority of the data in a dataset. They can arise due to various reasons, such as measurement errors, data entry mistakes, or inherent natural variations. If left unaddressed, outliers can significantly impact data analysis by skewing results and misleading interpretations.

Here's a breakdown of the key aspects covered in the repository:

1. Identifying Outliers:

Visualizations: Techniques like box plots and histograms can visually highlight potential outliers by identifying data points that fall outside the expected range.
Statistical Methods: Z-scores and Interquartile Range (IQR) can be used to statistically identify outliers based on their deviation from the mean/median and the overall spread of the data, respectively.

2. Handling Outliers (Techniques Discussed in Your Repository):

Trimming: This approach involves removing data points that fall beyond a predefined threshold (upper and lower limits).
Capping: Unlike trimming, capping replaces outlier values with the defined limits (upper limit for high outliers, lower limit for low outliers). This approach retains all data points but modifies extreme values.

3. Choosing the Right Technique:

The choice between trimming and capping depends on factors such as the nature of the data, the severity of outliers, and the intended analysis. Trimming can be suitable when outliers are considered genuine errors or if data loss is acceptable. Capping might be preferable if preserving all data points is crucial, even if it affects the distribution slightly.
